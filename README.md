# Computercraft Scripts

This repo is going to be a collection of scripts I write for use within the CC: Tweaked minecraft mod.

There is a limited number of scripts I can store on pastebin, so this is where I will keep all extras. 

I may also try to figure out a way to get programs onto the turtles without relying on pastebin (over http)
